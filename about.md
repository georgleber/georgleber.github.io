Hey there :wave:, I am Georg!
\
\
My career as software developer started quiet late. Funny side info: When I was in school, I deselected the informatics
course, because the learning material was too boring for me. After graduation, I was confronted with life and had to
look for a career path. Fortunately, I was able to start my search during my civilian service, where I came in contact
with software development.
\
\
Wind forward to 2023. Nowadays, I am a passionate and skilled fullstack software developer with more than 15 years of
experience. I had the chance to work extensively on enterprise applications and so get in contact with modern web and
cloud applications.
\
\
In my spare time, I like to go hiking in The Alps with my family and my dog. I like the nature and (depending on the
track) the silence and there is no better way to relax your mind.
\
Besides that I found fun in baking my own bread. I am still at the beginning but already made some delicious bread. One
or another recipe might find its way to my blog.
\
In my youth I learned flying gliders and have a (non-active) pilot license. Unfortunately, I don't have enough time
these days, so I have to use the flight simulator (X-Plane 12) to go flying. On quiet days you may find me in the IVAO
network trying to do some IFR flying.
